The purpose of this project is to investigate the raw data and identify any problems, such as inconsistent column names, missing data, duplicate rows, sloppy data, and unexpected data types. Once these issues were identified, the data needed to be cleaned and prepared for analysis.
Renaming columns with inconsistent names, dropping missing data, detecting, and identifying and removing duplicate rows were all part of the process.
Matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to create visuals in this project.
